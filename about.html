        <p>My name is Tina Johnson and though I grew up in Georgia, I now live in Jacksonville Florida.</p>
        <p>I originally got my associates degree in Baking and Pastry and I have spent the last 10 years </p>
        <p>as a Pastry Chef specializing in those large custom event cakes like you see on T.V. I made the </p>
        <p>decision in early 2021 that I was ready to change careers and I knew almost immediately that I </p>
        <p>wanted to go back to school for computer science because I was raised by my grandparents, </p>
        <p>and my Grandfather has been in IT basically since it has existed. He still loves his job even though</p>
        <p>he's retired so I wanted to follow in his footsteps and went back to school. I am currently attending</p>
        <p>The University of the people for my Bachelors of Computer Science and I hope to graduate in 2024.</p>
        <p>In the meantime I have just graduated from the Thinkful full immersion software engineering bootcamp</p>
        <p>where I completed several projects using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, PostgreSQL, and knex. I have</p>
        <p>also been attending the FastTrack Java developer program where I have additionally been learning Java</p>
        <p>JPA, and Spring Boot. I am now looking foward to using my new skills to gain some real industry experience.</p>
